      "question": "Which number is 5,000 less than 78,452 when rounded to the nearest thousand?",
      "options": [
        "72,000",
        "73,000",
        "74,000",
        "75,000"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "First, round 78,452 to nearest thousand: 78,452 → 78,000 (since hundreds digit is 4, which is less than 5). Then subtract 5,000: 78,000 - 5,000 = 73,000."

      "id": 2,
      "question": "The sum of two numbers is 84,765. If one number is 37,892, what is the other number rounded to the nearest hundred?",

        "46,800",
        "46,900",
        "47,000",
        "46,870"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "First find the other number: 84,765 - 37,892 = 46,873. Now round 46,873 to nearest hundred: Look at tens digit (7) which is 5 or more, so round up. 46,873 → 46,900."

      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Pattern increases by 5: 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75. Missing numbers are 50 and 70. Sum = 50 + 70 = 120."

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "After donation, total must be between 51,500 and 52,499 to round to 52,000. For smallest donation, we want the smallest new total: 51,500. Donation = 51,500 - 48,765 = 2,735. This is the smallest possible donation that makes the total round to 52,000."

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Find number between 55,000-56,000 that leaves remainder 3 when ÷8, and remainder 5 when ÷9. Test: 55,067 ÷ 8 = 6,883 remainder 3. 55,067 ÷ 9 = 6,118 remainder 5. So 55,067 satisfies both conditions."
