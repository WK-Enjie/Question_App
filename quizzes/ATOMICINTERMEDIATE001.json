        "Sodium loses one electron",
        "Sodium gains one proton",
        "Sodium loses one proton"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Sodium (atomic number 11) has electron configuration 2.8.1. It loses one electron from its outer shell to form Na⁺ with stable noble gas configuration 2.8."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "What is the electron configuration of a fluoride ion (F⁻)?",

        "2.7",
        "2.8",
        "2.8.8",
        "2.8.1"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Fluorine (atomic number 9) has electron configuration 2.7. It gains one electron to form F⁻ with stable noble gas configuration 2.8 (matching neon)."

      "id": 3,
      "question": "Carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. Which of the following is an isotope of carbon-12?",
      "options": [
        "An atom with 6 protons and 6 neutrons",
        "An atom with 6 protons and 7 neutrons",
        "An atom with 7 protons and 6 neutrons",
        "An atom with 6 protons and 8 electrons"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Isotopes are atoms of the same element (same number of protons) with different numbers of neutrons. Carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. An isotope must have 6 protons but a different number of neutrons, such as 7 neutrons (carbon-13). Option C describes nitrogen (different element). Option D describes an ion, not an isotope."

    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "The relative atomic mass of chlorine is 35.5. This is because:",
      "options": [
        "Chlorine atoms have different numbers of protons",
        "Chlorine exists as a mixture of isotopes with different abundances",
        "Chlorine atoms can gain or lose electrons",
        "Chlorine has a fractional number of neutrons"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Chlorine has two stable isotopes: ³⁵Cl (75% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (25% abundance). The relative atomic mass is the weighted average: (0.75 × 35) + (0.25 × 37) = 35.5."

        "³⁷Cl",
        "³⁴Cl"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Atomic number = number of protons = 17 (chlorine). Mass number = protons + neutrons = 17 + 18 = 35. Therefore, the symbol is ³⁵Cl."

        "80.5",
        "81.0"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Relative atomic mass = (0.507 × 79) + (0.493 × 81) = 40.053 + 39.933 = 79.986, which rounds to 80.0 to one decimal place."

      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Isotopes have the same number of protons (which defines the element) but different numbers of neutrons. Therefore, statement D is false—different proton numbers would mean different elements."

        "All ions have the same number of protons and electrons"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Ions are atoms or molecules with a net electrical charge due to loss or gain of electrons. Cations are positive (loss of electrons), anions are negative (gain of electrons). Ions never have equal protons and electrons."

        "A calcium ion with 2+ charge",
        "A calcium ion with 2- charge",
        "An isotope of potassium"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "20 protons = calcium (atomic number 20). With 18 electrons (2 fewer than protons), it has a 2+ charge. This is a Ca²⁺ ion. The number of neutrons (20) confirms it is calcium-40, not an isotope of another element."
