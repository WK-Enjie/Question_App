      "explanation": "Find the difference from 1: 1 - 5/6 = 1/6 ≈ 0.167, 1 - 7/8 = 1/8 = 0.125, 4/3 - 1 = 1/3 ≈ 0.333, 1 - 4/5 = 1/5 = 0.2. 7/8 has the smallest difference (0.125)."

The difference becomes 10 cards. Using model drawing: Each unit represents 1/4 of original. After transfers, difference is 1/2 unit = 10 cards, so 1 unit = 20 cards. Original for Wei Wei = 4 units = 4 × 25 = 100 cards. (Checking: If each had 100, Wei gives 25 to Qi, Wei=75, Qi=125. Qi gives 20 back: Wei=95, Qi=105. Difference = 10, correct!)"
