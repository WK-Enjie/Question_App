    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "Which of the following correctly represents a physical quantity?",
      "options": [
        "5.2",
        "5.2 m/s",
        "Speed",
        "Meter"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A physical quantity consists of a numerical magnitude and a unit. '5.2 m/s' includes both a number (5.2) and a unit (m/s)."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "Which of the following is a base quantity in the SI system?",
      "options": [
        "Volume",
        "Force",
        "Temperature",
        "Velocity"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Temperature (measured in Kelvin, K) is one of the seven base quantities in the SI system. The others are mass, length, time, electric current, amount of substance, and luminous intensity."

    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "The diameter of a red blood cell is approximately 0.000007 m. Which prefix best represents this measurement?",
      "options": [
        "kilo (k)",
        "milli (m)",
        "micro (µ)",
        "nano (n)"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "0.000007 m = 7 × 10⁻⁶ m. The prefix 'micro' (µ) represents 10⁻⁶, so the diameter is 7 µm."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "Which of the following best represents the order of magnitude for the diameter of the Earth?",
      "options": [
        "10⁷ m",
        "10⁹ m",
        "10³ m",
        "10¹¹ m"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The diameter of the Earth is roughly 12,742,000 m, which is approximately 1.3 × 10⁷ m. The order of magnitude is 10⁷ m."

      "id": 5,
      "question": "You need to measure the length of a pencil (≈ 15 cm) with high precision. Which instrument is most appropriate?",
      "options": [
        "Meter rule (precision 0.1 cm)",
        "Measuring tape (precision 0.5 cm)",
        "Vernier calipers (precision 0.01 cm)",
        "Trundle wheel (precision 1 cm)"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Vernier calipers have the highest precision (0.01 cm or 0.1 mm) among the options, making them suitable for an accurate measurement of a small object like a pencil."

    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "Which of the following is a vector quantity?",
      "options": [
        "Mass",
        "Time",
        "Speed",
        "Force"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Force is a vector quantity because it has both magnitude and direction. Mass, time, and speed are scalar quantities (magnitude only)."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "What does the prefix 'giga' (G) represent?",
      "options": [
        "10⁻⁹",
        "10⁶",
        "10⁹",
        "10¹²"

      "id": 8,
      "question": "The base unit for electric current is:",
      "options": [
        "Coulomb (C)",
        "Volt (V)",
        "Ampere (A)",
        "Ohm (Ω)"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The ampere (A) is the SI base unit for electric current. Coulomb, volt, and ohm are derived units."
