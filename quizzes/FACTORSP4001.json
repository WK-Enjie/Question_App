      "question": "There are between 30 and 50 sweets. If the sweets are divided into groups of 6, there is a remainder of 3. If the sweets are divided into groups of 4, there is a remainder of 1. How many sweets are there?",
      "options": [
        "37",
        "39",
        "45",
        "49"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Numbers between 30-50 with remainder 3 when divided by 6: 33, 39, 45. Among these, check remainder when divided by 4: 33 ÷ 4 = 8R1, 39 ÷ 4 = 9R3, 45 ÷ 4 = 11R1. Both 33 and 45 satisfy the conditions, but only 45 appears in the options. Therefore, the answer is 45."

      "question": "A teacher has some sweets between 40 and 50. When each student receives 8 sweets, the teacher is short of 1 sweet (needs 1 more sweet to give every student 8). When each student receives 7 sweets, there are 5 sweets left. How many sweets are there?",

      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Being short of 1 sweet for groups of 8 means the number is 1 less than a multiple of 8. Multiples of 8 near 40-50: 40, 48. Numbers 1 less: 39, 47. Only 47 is between 40-50. Check division by 7: 47 ÷ 7 = 6 remainder 5, which matches the second condition."
