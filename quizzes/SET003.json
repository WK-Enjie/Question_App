        "⊆",
        "∩"
      ],

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "A proper subset is not equal to the original set. Both {1, 2} and ∅ are proper subsets, but {1, 2} is listed as an option and is correct."

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The empty set is a subset of every set, including itself. ∅ ∉ ∅ (empty set is not an element of itself)."

        "R ∪ S = ξ"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "All squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares. So S ⊂ R (S is a proper subset of R)."

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "n(M ∪ E) = n(M)+n(E)-n(M ∩ E) = 30+25-10=45. Neither = n(ξ) - n(M ∪ E) = 50-45=5."
