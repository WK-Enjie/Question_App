    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "What are the roots of the quadratic equation: x² - 5x + 6 = 0?",
      "options": ["x = 1, x = 6", "x = 2, x = 3", "x = -2, x = -3", "x = 5, x = 1"],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Factor: (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0 → Roots are x = 2 and x = 3."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "A quadratic function has turning point (3, -4) and passes through point (1, 0). What is its equation in turning point form?",
      "options": [
        "y = (x - 3)² - 4",
        "y = (x + 3)² - 4",
        "y = (x - 3)² + 4",
        "y = (x - 1)² - 4"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Turning point form: y = a(x - h)² + k. Turning point (3, -4) gives y = a(x - 3)² - 4. Plug (1, 0): 0 = a(1 - 3)² - 4 → 0 = 4a - 4 → a = 1. So y = (x - 3)² - 4."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "The quadratic equation y = -2x² + 8x - 6 represents a projectile's height (meters) over time (seconds). At what time does it reach maximum height?",
      "options": ["1 second", "2 seconds", "3 seconds", "4 seconds"],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Maximum height occurs at turning point: t = -b/(2a) = -8/(2*(-2)) = 8/4 = 2 seconds."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "Which graph represents a quadratic with discriminant D = -12?",
      "options": [
        "Parabola intersecting x-axis at two points",
        "Parabola touching x-axis at one point",
        "Parabola entirely above x-axis",
        "Parabola entirely below x-axis"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Discriminant negative → No real roots → Parabola does not cross x-axis. Since leading coefficient is positive in standard form examples, it opens upward → entirely above x-axis."

      "id": 5,
      "question": "Solve using quadratic formula: 3x² + 7x - 2 = 0",

        "x = (7 ± √73)/6",
        "x = (-7 ± √73)/3"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "a=3, b=7, c=-2 → D = b² - 4ac = 49 + 24 = 73 → x = [-7 ± √73] / (2*3) = (-7 ± √73)/6."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "The area of a rectangle is 54 m². The length is 3 m more than twice the width. Which quadratic equation models this?",
      "options": [
        "2w² + 3w - 54 = 0",
        "w² + 3w - 54 = 0",
        "2w² + 3w + 54 = 0",
        "w² - 3w - 54 = 0"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Let width = w → length = 2w + 3. Area = w(2w + 3) = 54 → 2w² + 3w - 54 = 0."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "Given f(x) = 2(x - 1)² - 8, what is the axis of symmetry?",
      "options": ["x = -1", "x = 1", "x = -8", "x = 2"],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Turning point form y = a(x - h)² + k has axis of symmetry x = h. Here h = 1 → x = 1."

    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "A ball is thrown upward from a height of 5m with initial velocity 20 m/s. Height h(t) = -5t² + 20t + 5. When does it hit the ground?",
      "options": ["2 seconds", "4.24 seconds", "5 seconds", "4.56 seconds"],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Solve -5t² + 20t + 5 = 0 → Divide by -5: t² - 4t - 1 = 0 → t = [4 ± √(16 + 4)]/2 = [4 ± √20]/2 ≈ [4 ± 4.472]/2 → Positive root ≈ 4.236 seconds ≈ 4.24 s."
