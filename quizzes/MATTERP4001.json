    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "Which state of matter has a fixed shape and fixed volume?",
      "options": [
        "Solid",
        "Liquid",
        "Gas",
        "Plasma"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Solids have a fixed shape and fixed volume. Think of a toy brick - it keeps its shape and size no matter what container you put it in."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "Which property do liquids and gases share?",
      "options": [
        "Fixed shape",
        "Fixed volume",
        "No fixed shape",
        "Cannot be compressed"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Both liquids and gases have no fixed shape - they take the shape of their container. Water takes the shape of a cup, and air takes the shape of a balloon."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "Which of these is a property of gases?",
      "options": [
        "Have fixed volume",
        "Have fixed shape",
        "Can be compressed",
        "Cannot flow"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Gases can be squashed or compressed into smaller spaces. For example, you can squeeze more air into a bicycle tire."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "In an experiment, three different substances were tested: Substance A fills its container completely, Substance B takes the shape of its container but has a flat surface, Substance C keeps its own shape. Which is solid, liquid and gas?",
      "options": [
        "A-gas, B-liquid, C-solid",
        "A-liquid, B-solid, C-gas",
        "A-solid, B-gas, C-liquid",
        "A-liquid, B-gas, C-solid"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Substance A fills container completely = gas, Substance B takes shape with flat surface = liquid, Substance C keeps own shape = solid."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "A student has three identical boxes. She puts a stone in Box 1, water in Box 2, and air in Box 3. Which box will feel the lightest?",
      "options": [
        "Box 1 (stone)",
        "Box 2 (water)",
        "Box 3 (air)",
        "All will feel the same"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Air (gas) is much lighter than water or stone. That's why balloons filled with helium float in the air."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "Which item would be BEST to use in an experiment to show that gases have no fixed shape?",
      "options": [
        "A wooden block",
        "A cup of water",
        "A balloon",
        "An ice cube"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "A balloon shows gases have no fixed shape - when you blow into it, the air takes the balloon's shape. If you squeeze it, the air changes shape again."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "What is the BEST way to prove that air (a gas) takes up space?",
      "options": [
        "Weigh an empty balloon and a blown-up balloon",
        "Try to push an upside-down cup into water",
        "Watch smoke rise into the air",
        "Measure how much water evaporates"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "When you push an upside-down cup into water, the air trapped inside stops water from filling the cup completely. This shows air takes up space."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "Which of these is a solid?",
      "options": [
        "Milk",
        "Oxygen",
        "Sand",
        "Juice"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Sand is a solid - each grain has its own fixed shape. Milk and juice are liquids, and oxygen is a gas we breathe."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "In a classification activity, students sorted items: Group X: pencil, eraser, book. Group Y: oil, vinegar, milk. Group Z: helium, oxygen, carbon dioxide. What property were they using to sort?",
      "options": [
        "Colour",
        "Weight",
        "State of matter",
        "Temperature"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Group X are solids (keep their shape), Group Y are liquids (take container shape), Group Z are gases (fill containers completely)."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "Which experiment shows that solids have fixed shape?",
      "options": [
        "Pouring water from one cup to another",
        "Blowing up different shaped balloons",
        "Putting a toy car in different containers",
        "Watching steam rise from hot water"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "A toy car keeps its car shape whether it's in a box, on a table, or in your hand. This shows solids don't change shape like liquids or gases do."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "What property do ALL solids have?",
      "options": [
        "They are hard",
        "They are heavy",
        "They have fixed shape",
        "They can flow"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "All solids have fixed shape. Some solids like cotton wool are soft, and some like feathers are light, but they all keep their shape."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "Why can you pour a liquid from one container to another?",
      "options": [
        "Because it has fixed shape",
        "Because it can flow",
        "Because it is heavy",
        "Because it is wet"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Liquids can flow, which means they can move and change shape. That's why you can pour juice from a carton into a glass."
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "Which two states of matter can flow?",
      "options": [
        "Solid and liquid",
        "Liquid and gas",
        "Solid and gas",
        "Only liquid"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Both liquids and gases can flow. Liquids flow downhill like water in a river, and gases can flow like wind blowing through a window."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "A student blows air into a plastic bag and seals it. Then she tries to squeeze it. What property of gases is she showing?",
      "options": [
        "Gases have fixed shape",
        "Gases can be compressed",
        "Gases have fixed volume",
        "Gases are always visible"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "When she squeezes the bag, the air inside gets squashed into a smaller space. This shows gases can be compressed or squashed."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "A student uses a syringe filled with air. She pushes the plunger down and can squash the air into a smaller space. What property of gases is she demonstrating?",
      "options": [
        "Gases have fixed volume",
        "Gases can be compressed",
        "Gases have fixed shape",
        "Gases are visible"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "When she pushes the plunger, the air inside the syringe gets squashed into a smaller space. This shows that gases can be compressed, unlike solids and liquids which cannot be compressed easily."
