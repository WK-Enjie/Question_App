      "question": "Which metal reacts violently with cold water, producing an alkaline solution and hydrogen gas?",
      "options": [
        "Iron",

        "Sodium",
        "Magnesium"
      ],

        "Magnesium"
      ],
      "correct": 2,

        "Calcium",
        "Zinc"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Iron reacts with steam to form iron(III) oxide and hydrogen: 3Fe + 4H₂O(g) → Fe₃O₄ + 4H₂, but reacts very slowly or not at all with cold water."

    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "What is the correct order of reactivity (most reactive first) for these metals?",

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "From the reactivity series: Mg (most reactive of these) > Zn > Fe > Cu (least reactive)."
    },

      "id": 5,
      "question": "In a displacement reaction, zinc powder is added to copper(II) sulfate solution. What is observed?",

        "Gas bubbles produced",
        "White precipitate forms"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Zn + CuSO₄ → ZnSO₄ + Cu. Blue Cu²⁺ ions are replaced by colourless Zn²⁺ ions. Brown copper metal solid forms."

      "id": 6,
      "question": "A student adds copper to iron(II) sulfate solution and observes no reaction. What does this indicate?",
      "options": [
        "Copper is less reactive than iron",
        "The reaction is too slow to observe",
        "Copper is more reactive than iron",
        "Sulfate ions interfere"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Copper is below iron in the reactivity series, so it cannot displace iron from its salt solution. Hence, no reaction occurs."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "Which metal can displace hydrogen from cold water but reacts only moderately?",
      "options": [
        "Gold",
        "Calcium",
        "Lead",
        "Mercury"

      "id": 8,
      "question": "What is the meaning of a displacement reaction in terms of the reactivity series?",
      "options": [
        "A more reactive metal displaces a less reactive metal from its compound",
        "A less reactive metal displaces a more reactive metal",
        "Two metals of equal reactivity exchange places",
        "Non-metals displace metals"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Displacement occurs when a more reactive metal takes the place of a less reactive metal in a compound."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "Aluminium appears less reactive than expected because:",
      "options": [
        "It is actually a noble metal",
        "It forms a protective oxide layer",
        "It does not conduct electricity well",
        "It is below hydrogen in the series"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Aluminium quickly forms Al₂O₃ on its surface, which prevents further reaction, making it appear less reactive."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "In the reaction: Metal X + Copper(II) oxide → Metal X oxide + Copper. This occurs readily. What can be deduced?",

        "Metal X is less reactive than copper",
        "Metal X is more reactive than copper",
        "Metal X is copper",
        "No conclusion can be drawn"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A metal can displace another from its oxide only if it is more reactive. So Metal X is more reactive than copper."

    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "From displacement experiments, metal P displaces metal Q from nitrate solution, and metal Q displaces metal R. What is the reactivity order?",

        "P > R > Q"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "If P displaces Q, then P > Q. If Q displaces R, then Q > R. So overall: P > Q > R."

    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "Why is potassium stored under oil?",
      "options": [
        "To prevent reaction with oxygen and water vapour",
        "To make it shine",
        "To increase its reactivity",
        "To prevent it from melting"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Potassium is so reactive it reacts violently with air (oxygen) and water vapour. Oil excludes these."
