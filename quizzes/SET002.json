    {

        "∅",
        "∈",
        "⊆",
        "∩"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "∅ is the symbol for the empty set (set with no elements)."

        "{1, 2}",
        "∅ only"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "A proper subset is a subset that is not equal to the original set. {1, 2} ⊂ A and ∅ ⊂ A are both proper subsets, but the question asks for 'a' proper subset, so {1, 2} is correct."

        "(A ∪ B)'",
        "A' ∩ B'"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Outside A (A') and outside B (B') → A' ∩ B' = (A ∪ B)'."

        "n(∅) = 0",
        "∅ is a subset of itself"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "∅ has no elements, so ∅ ∉ ∅. The empty set is not an element of itself."

        "R ∪ S = ξ"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "All squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares. So S ⊂ R (S is a subset of R)."

      "explanation": "n(M ∪ E) = n(M)+n(E)-n(M ∩ E) = 30+25-10=45. Neither = n(ξ) - n(M ∪ E) = 50-45=5."
