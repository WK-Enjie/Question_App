      "question": "A farmer has chickens and rabbits in a cage. There are 12 heads and 38 legs altogether. How many rabbits are there?",
      "options": ["5 rabbits", "9 rabbits", "7 rabbits", "8 rabbits"],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Assume all 12 animals are chickens. Total legs would be 12 × 2 = 24 legs. But there are actually 38 legs, so we have 38 – 24 = 14 extra legs. Each rabbit has 2 more legs than a chicken (4 – 2 = 2). Number of rabbits: 14 ÷ 2 = 7 rabbits."

      "question": "In a car park, there are cars and motorcycles. There are 15 vehicles with 52 wheels altogether. How many cars are there?",
      "options": ["13 cars", "10 cars", "12 cars", "11 cars"],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Assume all 15 vehicles are motorcycles. Total wheels would be 15 × 2 = 30 wheels. But there are actually 52 wheels, so we have 52 – 30 = 22 extra wheels. Each car has 2 more wheels than a motorcycle (4 – 2 = 2). Number of cars: 22 ÷ 2 = 11 cars."

      "question": "A quiz has 20 questions. You get 5 points for each correct answer and lose 2 points for each wrong answer. If you answered all questions and scored 58 points, how many questions did you answer correctly?",
      "options": ["18 questions", "12 questions", "16 questions", "14 questions"],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Assume all 20 answers are correct. Total points would be 20 × 5 = 100 points. But you actually scored 58 points, so you lost 100 – 58 = 42 points. For each wrong answer, you lose 7 points total (5 points not gained plus 2 points deducted). Number of wrong answers: 42 ÷ 7 = 6. Correct answers: 20 – 6 = 14 questions."

      "options": ["10 coins", "14 coins", "8 coins", "12 coins"],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Assume all 20 coins are 20¢ coins. Total value would be 20 × 20¢ = 400¢ = $4.00. But the actual value is $7.60 = 760¢, so we have 760 – 400 = 360¢ extra. Each 50¢ coin has 30¢ more than a 20¢ coin (50 – 20 = 30). Number of 50¢ coins: 360 ÷ 30 = 12 coins."

      "options": ["20 ducks", "18 ducks", "15 ducks", "12 ducks"],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Assume all 25 animals are cows. Total legs would be 25 × 4 = 100 legs. But there are actually 70 legs, so we have 100 – 70 = 30 fewer legs. Each duck has 2 fewer legs than a cow (4 – 2 = 2). Number of ducks: 30 ÷ 2 = 15 ducks."

      "options": ["10 packets", "6 packets", "12 packets", "8 packets"],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Assume all 30 packets contain 250 ml. Total volume would be 30 × 250 ml = 7500 ml = 7.5 litres. But the actual volume is 10.5 litres = 10 500 ml, so we have 10 500 – 7500 = 3000 ml extra. Each 500 ml packet has 250 ml more than a 250 ml packet (500 – 250 = 250). Number of 500 ml packets: 3000 ÷ 250 = 12 packets."

      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Assume all 15 answers are correct. Total marks would be 15 × 4 = 60 marks. But James actually scored 40 marks, so he lost 60 – 40 = 20 marks. For each wrong answer, he loses 5 marks total (4 marks not gained plus 1 mark deducted). Number of wrong answers: 20 ÷ 5 = 4 questions."

      "options": ["8 packs", "10 packs", "6 packs", "9 packs"],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Assume all 12 packs are small packs. Total pencils would be 12 × 4 = 48 pencils. But there are actually 66 pencils, so we have 66 – 48 = 18 extra pencils. Each large pack has 3 more pencils than a small pack (7 – 4 = 3). Number of large packs: 18 ÷ 3 = 6 packs."

      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Assume all 18 creatures are spiders. Total legs would be 18 × 8 = 144 legs. But there are actually 128 legs, so we have 144 – 128 = 16 fewer legs. Each beetle has 2 fewer legs than a spider (8 – 6 = 2). Number of beetles: 16 ÷ 2 = 8 beetles."

      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Assume all 30 animals are chickens. Total legs would be 30 × 2 = 60 legs. But there are actually 88 legs, so we have 88 – 60 = 28 extra legs. Each goat has 2 more legs than a chicken (4 – 2 = 2). Number of goats: 28 ÷ 2 = 14 goats."
