      "question": "John has $30. Each book costs $7. He buys b books and has less than $5 left. Write inequality and find greatest possible b.",
      "options": [
        "7b > 25, b ≤ 3",

        "30 - 7b ≤ 5, b = 4"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Money left: 30 - 7b < 5 → -7b < -25 → b > 25/7 ≈ 3.57. Greatest integer b = 3? Wait, b > 3.57 means b ≥ 4? Let's solve: 30 - 7b < 5 → 25 < 7b → b > 25/7 ≈ 3.57. So smallest integer that works is 4. But 'greatest possible b' means the largest integer satisfying? Actually if b > 3.57, integers are 4,5,6... but limited by $30: 7b ≤ 30 → b ≤ 4.28. So b can be 4 only. So greatest b = 4."
