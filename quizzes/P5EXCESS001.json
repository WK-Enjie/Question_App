      "question": "A teacher has some sweets. If she gives 4 sweets to each pupil, she will have 18 sweets left. If she gives 6 sweets to each pupil, she will have 4 sweets left. How many pupils are there?",
      "options": ["11 pupils", "9 pupils", "7 pupils", "8 pupils"],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "When giving 2 more sweets to each pupil (6 minus 4), the leftover sweets decrease by 14 (18 minus 4). These 14 extra sweets were used to give 2 more to each pupil. Number of pupils: 14 ÷ 2 = 7 pupils."

      "options": ["42 cookies", "38 cookies", "44 cookies", "40 cookies"],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "When giving 2 more cookies to each child (5 minus 3), the leftover cookies decrease by 16 (20 minus 4). Number of children: 16 ÷ 2 = 8 children. Total cookies: 8 children × 3 cookies each + 20 leftover = 24 + 20 = 44 cookies."

      "options": ["7 friends", "9 friends", "6 friends", "8 friends"],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "When each friend contributes $2 more ($7 minus $5), the group changes from being $8 short to having $4 extra. This is a total swing of $12 ($8 plus $4). This $12 comes from each friend adding $2 more. Number of friends: $12 ÷ $2 = 6 friends."
