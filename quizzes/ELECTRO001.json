    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "What is produced at the cathode during electrolysis of molten sodium chloride (NaCl)?",
      "options": [
        "Sodium metal",
        "Chlorine gas",
        "Hydrogen gas",
        "Oxygen gas"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Molten NaCl: Na⁺ ions migrate to cathode, gain electrons → Na(l). Cl⁻ ions to anode → Cl₂(g)."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "During electrolysis of dilute aqueous sodium chloride (NaCl) using inert electrodes, what forms at the anode?",
      "options": [
        "Chlorine gas",
        "Oxygen gas",
        "Hydrogen gas",
        "Sodium metal"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Aqueous NaCl: OH⁻ and Cl⁻ go to anode. OH⁻ discharged preferentially (dilute) → oxygen gas. Chlorine forms only with concentrated solution."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "Electrolysis of molten lead(II) bromide (PbBr₂) produces:",
      "options": [
        "Lead at cathode, bromine at anode",
        "Bromine at cathode, lead at anode",
        "Hydrogen at cathode, oxygen at anode",
        "Lead and bromine both at anode"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Molten PbBr₂: Pb²⁺ reduced at cathode → Pb(l). Br⁻ oxidised at anode → Br₂(g)."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "Why is aluminium extracted by electrolysis of molten alumina (Al₂O₃) and not aqueous solution?",
      "options": [
        "Aluminium reacts with water",
        "Al³⁺ ions are not discharged in aqueous solution",
        "Aluminium is less reactive than hydrogen",
        "Alumina is insoluble in water"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Aluminium is more reactive than hydrogen. In aqueous solution, H⁺ would be discharged instead of Al³⁺, so no Al forms. Molten state needed."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Electrolysis of concentrated aqueous copper(II) chloride (CuCl₂) produces:",
      "options": [
        "Copper at cathode, chlorine at anode",
        "Hydrogen at cathode, oxygen at anode",
        "Copper at anode, chlorine at cathode",
        "Hydrogen at cathode, chlorine at anode"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Concentrated CuCl₂(aq): Cu²⁺ reduced at cathode → Cu(s). Cl⁻ oxidised at anode → Cl₂(g). No H⁺/OH⁻ discharged due to concentration and lower discharge potential of Cl⁻ over OH⁻ here."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "What is the key difference between electrolysis of molten salt and aqueous salt?",
      "options": [
        "Aqueous involves water molecules that may be discharged",
        "Molten salts conduct electricity better",
        "Aqueous electrolysis always produces hydrogen and oxygen",
        "Molten salts require higher voltage"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "In aqueous solutions, H⁺ and OH⁻ ions from water are present and may be discharged depending on concentration and position in electrochemical series."
