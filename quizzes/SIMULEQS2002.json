      "question": "A fraction has numerator p and denominator q. If 3 is added to both, the fraction becomes 5/7. If 1 is subtracted from both, it becomes 3/5. Find the original fraction.",
      "options": ["2/3", "5/9", "7/11", "9/13"],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Equations: (p+3)/(q+3) = 5/7 → 7p+21=5q+15 → 7p−5q=−6. (p−1)/(q−1)=3/5 → 5p−5=3q−3 → 5p−3q=2. Solve: p=7, q=11. Fraction = 7/11."
