    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "A student destarched a plant and then covered part of a leaf with black paper for 48 hours. After testing with iodine solution, the covered part remained brown while the uncovered part turned blue-black. What does this experiment prove?",
      "options": [
        "Light is necessary for photosynthesis",
        "Chlorophyll is necessary for photosynthesis",
        "Carbon dioxide is necessary for photosynthesis",
        "Oxygen is produced during photosynthesis"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The black paper prevents light from reaching the covered part. No starch is produced there, so it stays brown with iodine. The uncovered part photosynthesizes and produces starch, turning blue-black. This shows light is necessary."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "In an experiment, two similar potted plants were placed under a bell jar each. Jar A had soda lime (absorbs CO₂), Jar B had sodium bicarbonate (releases CO₂). Both were placed in sunlight. After several hours, only the plant in Jar B tested positive for starch with iodine. What factor is being investigated?",
      "options": [
        "Light intensity",
        "Carbon dioxide concentration",
        "Temperature",
        "Presence of chlorophyll"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Soda lime removes CO₂, sodium bicarbonate provides CO₂. The difference in starch production shows that carbon dioxide is necessary for photosynthesis."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "A variegated leaf (green and white parts) was tested with iodine after being exposed to sunlight. Only the green parts turned blue-black. What conclusion can be drawn?",
      "options": [
        "Light is needed for photosynthesis",
        "Chlorophyll is needed for photosynthesis",
        "Carbon dioxide is needed for photosynthesis",
        "Oxygen is produced only in green parts"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Variegated leaves have chlorophyll only in green areas. Since starch is found only in green parts after iodine test, it proves chlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "The rate of photosynthesis increases with light intensity up to a point, then levels off. What is the most likely reason it levels off?",
      "options": [
        "The chlorophyll gets damaged",
        "Another factor like CO₂ concentration or temperature becomes limiting",
        "The plant starts respiring instead",
        "Light becomes harmful at high intensity"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "After a certain light intensity, photosynthesis no longer increases because another factor (e.g., CO₂ level or temperature) becomes the limiting factor."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Which of the following is NOT a product of photosynthesis?",
      "options": [
        "Glucose",
        "Oxygen",
        "Water",
        "Starch (stored form)"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Water is a raw material (absorbed by roots), not a product. The main products are glucose and oxygen. Starch is a storage product made from glucose."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "What happens to most of the glucose produced during photosynthesis?",
      "options": [
        "It is released into the air as oxygen",
        "It is converted to starch for storage in leaves and roots",
        "It is converted to water for transport",
        "It is used up immediately to produce carbon dioxide"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Plants convert excess glucose into starch, which is insoluble and can be stored in leaves, stems, roots, and fruits for later use."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "Why do plants need to carry out respiration even though they can photosynthesize?",
      "options": [
        "To produce oxygen for other organisms",
        "To release energy from food for growth and repair",
        "To absorb carbon dioxide from the air",
        "To produce water for transport of nutrients"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Respiration releases energy stored in food (glucose). Plants need this energy for all life processes like growth, reproduction, and transporting nutrients."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "Which graph best shows how temperature affects the rate of photosynthesis?",
      "options": [
        "A straight line going up steadily",
        "A straight line going down steadily",
        "A curve that increases, peaks, then decreases",
        "A curve that decreases, bottoms out, then increases"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Photosynthesis increases with temperature up to an optimum point (around 25-30°C), then decreases as enzymes get damaged. This gives a curve that rises then falls."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "In the iodine test, what does a blue-black colour indicate?",
      "options": [
        "The presence of chlorophyll",
        "The presence of starch",
        "The presence of glucose",
        "The presence of carbon dioxide"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Iodine solution turns blue-black when it reacts with starch. This colour change is used to test if a leaf has been photosynthesizing."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "What is the main purpose of respiration in living things?",
      "options": [
        "To produce oxygen",
        "To release energy from food",
        "To remove carbon dioxide",
        "To produce water"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Respiration breaks down food (e.g., glucose) to release energy for life processes (movement, growth, etc.)."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "Which statement correctly compares photosynthesis and respiration?",
      "options": [
        "Both occur only in plants",
        "Both occur only in the presence of light",
        "Photosynthesis stores energy, respiration releases energy",
        "They use the same raw materials"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Photosynthesis converts light energy to chemical energy in food (stores energy). Respiration breaks down food to release that stored energy."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "In an experiment, a mouse is placed in a sealed container with a plant under a light. The mouse stays alive longer than if the plant were absent. Why?",
      "options": [
        "The plant provides food for the mouse",
        "The plant produces oxygen through photosynthesis",
        "The plant absorbs the mouse's waste",
        "The plant produces carbon dioxide for the mouse"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The plant photosynthesizes under light, producing oxygen which the mouse needs for respiration. It also absorbs the CO₂ the mouse breathes out."
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "What would be the result if a plant is kept in a completely dark cupboard for 3 days?",
      "options": [
        "It would produce more starch than usual",
        "It would use up its stored starch through respiration",
        "It would stop respiring completely",
        "It would start photosynthesizing using artificial light"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Without light, photosynthesis stops. The plant continues to respire, using up stored starch for energy, so starch levels in leaves decrease."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "Why is it important to destarch a plant before starting a photosynthesis experiment?",
      "options": [
        "To make the plant hungry so it photosynthesizes faster",
        "To ensure any starch found after the experiment was made during the experiment",
        "To remove chlorophyll for clearer results",
        "To weaken the plant's cells for iodine testing"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Destarching (placing in dark for 48 hrs) removes existing starch. Any starch detected after the experimental treatment is definitely produced under the tested conditions."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "Which of the following is TRUE about the relationship between photosynthesis and respiration in plants during the day?",
      "options": [
        "Photosynthesis stops and only respiration occurs",
        "Respiration stops and only photosynthesis occurs",
        "Both processes occur at the same time",
        "Neither process occurs during the day"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "During daylight, plants carry out both photosynthesis (producing food and oxygen) and respiration (using food to release energy) simultaneously."
