  "timeLimit": 900,
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "Sound waves are classified as longitudinal waves because:",
      "options": [
        "They travel faster than light",
        "They require a vacuum to propagate",
        "Air particles vibrate parallel to the direction of wave travel",
        "They have crests and troughs"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "In sound waves, air molecules oscillate back-and-forth along the same direction the wave travels, creating compressions and rarefactions."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "A student stands 170 m from a cliff and hears an echo 1.0 second later. What is the speed of sound in air?",
      "options": [
        "85 m/s",
        "170 m/s",
        "340 m/s",
        "680 m/s"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Sound travels to cliff AND back: total distance = 2 × 170 m = 340 m. Speed = distance/time = 340 m ÷ 1.0 s = 340 m/s."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "In which medium does sound travel fastest at room temperature?",
      "options": [
        "Air",
        "Water",
        "Steel",
        "Vacuum"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Sound speed: solids > liquids > gases. Steel (solid) ≈ 5000 m/s, water ≈ 1500 m/s, air ≈ 340 m/s. Sound cannot travel in vacuum."

        "Wavelength",
        "Amplitude",
        "Speed"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Greater amplitude = greater pressure variations = louder sound. Loudness is subjective perception of sound intensity."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Pitch of a sound is related to which wave property?",

      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Higher frequency → higher pitch (e.g., whistle). Lower frequency → lower pitch (e.g., drum)."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "An echo is heard 3.0 seconds after a shout. If sound speed is 340 m/s, how far is the reflecting surface?",

        "1020 m",
        "2040 m"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Total distance = speed × time = 340 m/s × 3.0 s = 1020 m. One-way distance = 1020 ÷ 2 = 510 m."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "Why does sound travel faster in warm air than in cold air?",
      "options": [
        "Warm air has higher density",
        "Warm air molecules have higher average kinetic energy",
        "Cold air absorbs sound energy",
        "Warm air has lower pressure"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Higher temperature → faster molecular motion → quicker transmission of vibrations → higher sound speed."

        "2.27 s",
        "0.00227 s",
        "0.440 s"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Period T = 1/f = 1/440 ≈ 0.00227 s (or 2.27 ms). This is the time for one complete vibration cycle."

    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "Which statement about the human hearing range is correct?",
      "options": [
        "Humans hear frequencies from 20 Hz to 2000 Hz",
        "Humans hear frequencies from 20 Hz to 20 000 Hz",
        "Humans hear all frequencies equally well",
        "Age does not affect hearing range"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Typical human hearing range: 20 Hz (low pitch) to 20 000 Hz (high pitch). Sensitivity decreases with age, especially at high frequencies."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "Two sounds have the same pitch but different loudness. What differs between their waveforms?",
      "options": [
        "Frequency only",
        "Wavelength only",
        "Amplitude only",
        "Speed only"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Same pitch = same frequency. Different loudness = different amplitudes. Wave speed depends on medium, not source characteristics."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "Sound cannot travel through a vacuum because:",
      "options": [
        "Vacuum absorbs all sound energy",
        "Sound waves are electromagnetic",
        "There are no particles to vibrate and transmit energy",
        "Vacuum has infinite density"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Sound is a mechanical wave requiring particles to transfer vibrational energy. Vacuum has no matter → no sound propagation."

      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Total distance = 1500 m/s × 4 s = 6000 m. Depth (one-way) = 6000 ÷ 2 = 3000 m."
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "Compared to air at 0°C, sound travels faster in air at 20°C because:",
      "options": [
        "Air density increases with temperature",
        "Air molecules move more slowly at higher temperatures",
        "Air molecules move more rapidly at higher temperatures",
        "Humidity decreases at higher temperatures"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Higher temperature → greater molecular kinetic energy → faster collision rate → quicker energy transfer → higher sound speed."
    },

      "id": 14,
      "question": "Which factor does NOT affect the speed of sound in a gas?",
      "options": [
        "Temperature",
        "Density of the gas",
        "Amplitude of the sound wave",
        "Molecular mass of the gas"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Sound speed in gases depends on temperature, density and molecular properties—but NOT on amplitude or frequency of the sound itself."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "A high-pitched sound and a low-pitched sound travel through the same medium. Which statement is true?",
      "options": [
        "The high-pitched sound travels faster",
        "The low-pitched sound travels faster",
        "Both travel at the same speed",
        "Speed depends on loudness, not pitch"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "In a given medium, sound speed is independent of frequency/pitch and amplitude/loudness. All sound frequencies travel at the same speed."
