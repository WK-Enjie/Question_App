      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Even numbers: 2, 4, 6 → 3 favorable outcomes. Total outcomes: 6. P(even) = 3/6 = 1/2."

      "explanation": "Independent events. P(first >5) = P(6,7,8) = 3/8. P(even) = P(2,4,6,8) = 4/8 = 1/2. Combined: (3/8)×(1/2) = 3/16? Wait 3/8 × 1/2 = 3/16, but that's not 3/32. Let's check: 3/8 × 1/2 = 3/16. But option says 3/32. Is that wrong? Actually, even numbers in 1-8: 2,4,6,8 → 4/8 = 1/2. So (3/8)×(1/2)=3/16. 3/16 is an option! So answer should be 3/16, not 3/32. I'll correct."
