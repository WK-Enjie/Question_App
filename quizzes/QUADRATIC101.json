        "x = 1, x = 12"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "x² - 7x + 12 = (x-3)(x-4) = 0 → x = 3 or x = 4."

      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Turning point at y=-3 (minimum since coefficient of x² positive). Horizontal line y=1 is above the turning point, so it will intersect at two points (curve goes up both sides)."

      "explanation": "Complete square: -2(x²-4x) -5 = -2[(x-2)²-4] -5 = -2(x-2)² + 8 -5 = -2(x-2)² + 3. Maximum is 3 when x=2."

        "5 cm",
        "8 cm"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Let width = w → length = w+4. Area = w(w+4)=60 → w²+4w-60=0 → (w+10)(w-6)=0 → w=6 cm (positive)."

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Turning point is minimum if positive x² coefficient. y=-3 is below the minimum point y=-2, so the curve never goes that low → no intersection."
