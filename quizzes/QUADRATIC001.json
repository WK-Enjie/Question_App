    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "A quadratic curve has a MINIMUM turning point at (2, -3). How many times does it intersect the horizontal line y = -5?",
      "options": [
        "0",
        "1",
        "2",
        "Cannot be determined"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Minimum point is at y=-3. The line y=-5 is BELOW this minimum, so the curve never goes that low → no intersection."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "A quadratic curve has a MAXIMUM turning point at (-1, 4). How many times does it intersect the horizontal line y = 2?",
      "options": [
        "0",
        "1",
        "2",
        "Cannot be determined"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Maximum is at y=4. The line y=2 is BELOW the maximum, so the curve crosses it twice (once on each side of the turning point)."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "Curve: y = x² - 6x + 8 (minimum curve). Intersects y = 0 at:",
      "options": [
        "x = 1 and x = 5",
        "x = 1 and x = 7",
        "x = 2 and x = 4",
        "No intersection"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Set x² - 6x + 8 = 0 → (x - 2)(x - 4) = 0 → x = 2 or x = 4. So the curve intersects the x-axis (y=0) at x = 2 and x = 4."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "A quadratic curve with MINIMUM at (0, 2). Does it intersect y = 2?",

        "No intersection",
        "One intersection (touches)",
        "Two intersections",
        "Infinite intersections"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The minimum point IS on the line y=2. Since it's a minimum, the curve touches the line at exactly one point (the turning point)."

        "x = 4 ± √3",
        "No intersection"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Set -x² + 4x - 1 = 0 → x² - 4x + 1 = 0 → x = [4 ± √(16-4)]/2 = [4 ± √12]/2 = [4 ± 2√3]/2 = 2 ± √3."

        "2",
        "Cannot say"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Maximum y-value is 5. The line y=6 is ABOVE the maximum, so the curve never reaches it → no intersection."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "Which horizontal line will intersect y = (x-4)² + 1 (minimum curve) at TWO points?",

        "y = 1",
        "y = 2",
        "y = 5"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Minimum is at y=1 (when x=4). For two intersections, the horizontal line must be ABOVE the minimum: y>1. Only y=2 satisfies."

      "id": 8,
      "question": "Curve: y = 2(x+1)² - 8 (minimum). Intersect with y = -10?",

        "Two points",
        "One point",
        "No intersection",
        "Cannot determine"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The curve has a minimum at y = -8 (vertex at (-1, -8)). Since y = -10 is below this minimum, the curve never reaches it. Therefore, there is no intersection."
