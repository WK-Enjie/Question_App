    {

      "question": "A quadratic curve has a MINIMUM turning point at (2, -3). How many times does it intersect the horizontal line y = -5?",

        "0",
        "1",

        "Cannot be determined"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Minimum point is at y=-3. The line y=-5 is BELOW this minimum, so the curve never goes that low → no intersection."
    },

      "question": "A quadratic curve has a MAXIMUM turning point at (-1, 4). How many times does it intersect the horizontal line y = 2?",

        "2",
        "Cannot be determined"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Maximum is at y=4. The line y=2 is BELOW the maximum, so the curve crosses it twice (once on each side of the turning point)."

        "x = 1 and x = 7",
        "x = 2 and x = 4",

      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Set x² - 6x + 8 = 1 → x² - 6x + 7 = 0 → Use quadratic formula: x = [6 ± √(36-28)]/2 = [6 ± √8]/2 = [6 ± 2√2]/2 = 3 ± √2 ≈ 1.59 and 4.41."

        "Two intersections",
        "Infinite intersections"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The minimum point IS on the line y=2. Since it's a minimum, the curve touches the line at exactly one point (the turning point)."

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Set -x² + 4x - 1 = 0 → x² - 4x + 1 = 0 → x = [4 ± √(16-4)]/2 = [4 ± √12]/2 = [4 ± 2√3]/2 = 2 ± √3."

      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Maximum y-value is 5. The line y=6 is ABOVE the maximum, so the curve never reaches it → no intersection."

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Minimum is at y=1 (when x=4). For two intersections, the horizontal line must be ABOVE the minimum: y>1. Only y=2 satisfies."

        "No intersection",

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Minimum is at y=-8. Line y=-10 is BELOW the minimum → Wait, that's wrong. If minimum is -8, line at -10 is below → curve never goes below -8 → NO intersection. Correction: Actually, minimum is -8, line y=-10 is below minimum → no intersection. But my options say 'Two points' is correct? That's an error in my logic. Let's fix: Minimum at -8, line at -10 → no intersection. So answer should be 'No intersection'."
