    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "What is electroplating?",
      "options": [
        "Using electricity to coat an object with a metal",
        "Extracting metals from ores",
        "Producing electricity from chemical reactions",
        "Splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Electroplating uses electrolysis to deposit a thin layer of metal onto an object (e.g., silver-plating cutlery)."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "In silver plating, the object to be plated is placed at the:",
      "options": [
        "Cathode",
        "Anode",
        "Both electrodes",
        "Not connected to circuit"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The object to be plated is made the cathode, so positive metal ions (Ag⁺) are attracted and reduced onto it."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "In copper refining, impure copper is made the:",
      "options": [
        "Anode",
        "Cathode",
        "Electrolyte",
        "Not used"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Impure copper is the anode. It dissolves, Cu²⁺ ions go into solution, then pure copper deposits on the cathode."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "Why is direct current (DC) used in electroplating, not alternating current (AC)?",
      "options": [
        "DC provides one-way flow to deposit metal steadily",
        "AC is too expensive",
        "DC is safer",
        "AC causes overheating"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "DC ensures metal ions always move toward the cathode and deposit. AC would reverse direction, preventing steady plating."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Which is a common use of electroplating?",
      "options": [
        "Chromium plating car bumpers",
        "Making batteries",
        "Producing chlorine",
        "Electrolysis of water"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Chromium plating is used for decoration and corrosion resistance on cars, taps, etc."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "In electroplating, the electrolyte contains:",
      "options": [
        "Ions of the plating metal",
        "Ions of the object metal",
        "Only water",
        "Acid only"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The electrolyte contains ions of the metal to be plated (e.g., Ag⁺ for silver plating)."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "During electroplating, oxidation occurs at the:",
      "options": [
        "Anode",
        "Cathode",
        "Both electrodes",
        "Neither"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Anode = oxidation (loss of electrons). In silver plating, silver anode oxidizes: Ag → Ag⁺ + e⁻."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "What happens if the object to be plated is made the anode instead of cathode?",
      "options": [
        "It dissolves instead of being coated",
        "Plating happens faster",
        "Nothing happens",
        "It gets plated with wrong metal"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "If object is anode, it loses electrons and dissolves instead of gaining metal coating."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "Electroplating is used to:",
      "options": [
        "Prevent corrosion and improve appearance",
        "Generate electricity",
        "Produce metals from ores",
        "Decompose compounds"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Main uses: corrosion resistance (e.g., zinc-plating iron) and decorative finish (e.g., gold-plating jewelry)."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "For successful electroplating, the object must be:",
      "options": [
        "Clean and grease-free",
        "Made of the same metal as the plating",
        "Very large",
        "Magnetic"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Surface must be clean so metal adheres well. Grease or dirt would cause poor plating."
