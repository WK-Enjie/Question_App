    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "In the electrolysis of copper(II) sulfate using REACTIVE copper electrodes, what happens to the mass of the anode and cathode?",
      "options": [
        "Anode gains mass; cathode loses mass",
        "Both electrodes gain mass",
        "Anode loses mass; cathode gains an equal mass",
        "Both electrodes lose mass"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Reactive copper anode dissolves: Cu → Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ (mass decreases). Same Cu²⁺ ions deposit at cathode: Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu (mass increases by same amount). Total copper in system remains constant."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "Which statement correctly describes the relationship between electroplating and sacrificial protection?",
      "options": [
        "All electroplating provides sacrificial protection against corrosion",
        "Chromium plating on steel provides sacrificial protection because chromium is more reactive than iron",
        "Sacrificial protection requires an external power source like electroplating",
        "Zinc coating on iron (galvanising) is sacrificial protection; chromium plating is barrier protection only"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Zinc is MORE reactive than iron → oxidizes preferentially (sacrificial protection). Chromium is LESS reactive than iron → only provides barrier protection; if scratched, iron corrodes faster as it becomes the anode relative to chromium."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "When INERT graphite electrodes are used to electrolyse concentrated sodium chloride solution, what is produced at the anode?",
      "options": [
        "Hydrogen gas",
        "Sodium metal",
        "Chlorine gas",
        "Oxygen gas"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "With inert electrodes in concentrated NaCl: Anode (oxidation): 2Cl⁻ → Cl₂ + 2e⁻ (chlorine gas). Cathode (reduction): 2H₂O + 2e⁻ → H₂ + 2OH⁻ (hydrogen gas). Dilute NaCl would give oxygen at anode."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "What is the PRIMARY purpose of chromium electroplating on car bumpers?",
      "options": [
        "To reduce the mass of the bumper",
        "To provide sacrificial protection against rust",
        "To make the bumper magnetic",
        "To improve appearance and provide barrier protection against corrosion"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Chromium plating provides a shiny decorative finish and forms a protective barrier against moisture and oxygen. It does NOT provide sacrificial protection because chromium is less reactive than iron."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "During silver electroplating using a REACTIVE silver anode, what happens at the anode?",
      "options": [
        "Silver ions are reduced to silver metal",
        "Oxygen gas is produced from water",
        "Silver metal oxidises to silver ions",
        "Hydrogen gas is produced"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "With reactive silver anode: Ag → Ag⁺ + e⁻ (oxidation). Silver dissolves to replenish Ag⁺ ions in solution. At the cathode (object), Ag⁺ + e⁻ → Ag deposits as a coating."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "Why is IMPURE copper used as the ANODE in copper refining?",
      "options": [
        "To prevent the cathode from dissolving",
        "So impurities dissolve and deposit on the cathode",
        "So pure copper dissolves and leaves impurities behind",
        "So impure copper dissolves, pure copper deposits on the cathode, and impurities fall as sludge"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Impure copper anode dissolves: Cu → Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻. Pure copper deposits on cathode: Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu. Less reactive impurities (e.g., Au, Ag) don't dissolve → fall as 'anode sludge'. More reactive impurities stay in solution."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "Why does electroplating with a LESS reactive metal (e.g., chromium on iron) NOT provide sacrificial protection?",
      "options": [
        "Chromium cannot conduct electricity",
        "The plating process consumes too much energy",
        "If the coating is scratched, the underlying iron becomes the anode and corrodes faster",
        "The plating metal reacts too slowly with oxygen"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "When scratched, iron (more reactive) and chromium (less reactive) form a galvanic cell. Iron becomes the anode and oxidizes preferentially → accelerated corrosion at the scratch site. This is the opposite of sacrificial protection."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "In the electrolysis of molten lead(II) bromide using INERT electrodes, what is observed at the cathode?",
      "options": [
        "Reddish-brown gas",
        "Shiny grey droplets of metal",
        "Colourless gas that pops with a lit splint",
        "Greenish-yellow gas"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Molten PbBr₂: Cathode (reduction): Pb²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Pb(l) → silvery-grey molten lead droplets. Anode (oxidation): 2Br⁻ → Br₂(g) + 2e⁻ → reddish-brown bromine vapour."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "Which statement about electroplating is TRUE?",
      "options": [
        "The object to be plated must be the anode",
        "The electrolyte must contain ions of the metal to be plated",
        "Alternating current (AC) gives better plating than direct current (DC)",
        "The anode must always be inert graphite"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The electrolyte must contain ions of the plating metal (e.g., Ag⁺ for silver plating). The object is the CATHODE (to attract positive metal ions). DC is required (AC would reverse plating). Anode can be reactive (same metal) or inert."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "When INERT graphite electrodes are used to electrolyse copper(II) sulfate solution, why is oxygen produced at the anode instead of copper dissolving?",
      "options": [
        "Copper ions are too stable to oxidise",
        "The graphite electrode blocks copper oxidation",
        "Sulfate ions oxidise more easily than copper metal",
        "The electrode is inert so copper cannot dissolve; instead water/sulfate oxidises to oxygen"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Inert electrodes do not participate in reactions. Since the anode isn't copper metal, copper cannot dissolve. Instead, water oxidises: 2H₂O → O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ (or OH⁻ oxidises). Sulfate ions are hard to oxidise."

    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "What is the key difference between using REACTIVE copper electrodes versus INERT graphite electrodes in copper(II) sulfate electrolysis?",
      "options": [
        "With inert electrodes, the blue colour fades; with reactive electrodes, the blue colour remains constant",
        "With reactive electrodes, oxygen is produced at the anode; with inert electrodes, copper dissolves",
        "With inert electrodes, the anode gains mass; with reactive electrodes, the anode loses mass",
        "With reactive electrodes, hydrogen is produced at the cathode; with inert electrodes, copper deposits"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Reactive Cu electrodes: Anode dissolves (Cu → Cu²⁺), cathode deposits Cu → [Cu²⁺] constant → blue colour unchanged. Inert graphite electrodes: Anode produces O₂ (from water), cathode deposits Cu → [Cu²⁺] decreases → blue colour fades."
