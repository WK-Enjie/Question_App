  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "Which force always pulls objects toward the center of the Earth?",
      "options": [
        "Frictional force",
        "Gravitational force",
        "Elastic force",
        "Magnetic force"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Gravitational force is the pull that the Earth exerts on all objects, pulling them toward its center. This is what gives objects weight."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "Which force always opposes the motion or attempted motion of an object?",
      "options": [
        "Gravitational force",
        "Frictional force",
        "Elastic force",
        "Magnetic force"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Friction always acts opposite to the direction of motion or attempted motion. It resists the sliding of surfaces against each other."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "A spring balance is used in two ways: hanging a mass from it (extension) and placing a mass on top of it (compression). What remains the same in both situations?",
      "options": [
        "The direction of spring movement",
        "The type of force being measured",
        "The way the scale is read",
        "The spring's unstretched length"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Both measure weight (gravitational force). Extension balances measure by stretching, compression balances by squashing, but both measure the same force type."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "Which statement about mass and weight is CORRECT?",
      "options": [
        "Mass is a force, weight is the amount of matter",
        "Mass changes with location, weight is constant",
        "Mass is measured in kg, weight is measured in N",
        "Mass and weight are the same thing measured differently"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Mass (amount of matter) is measured in kg and constant anywhere. Weight (force of gravity) is measured in Newtons and varies with gravitational field strength."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Two identical springs are tested. Spring A stretches 5 cm with 2 N load. Spring B stretches 10 cm with 2 N load. Which statement is true?",
      "options": [
        "Spring A is stiffer/less elastic",
        "Spring B is stiffer/less elastic",
        "Both have same elasticity",
        "Spring A has reached its elastic limit"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Stiffer springs extend less for the same force. Spring A extends less (5 cm vs 10 cm) for same 2 N, so it's stiffer/has greater spring constant."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "A bungee jumper falls off a platform. At which point does she have maximum gravitational potential energy?",
      "options": [
        "Just as she starts falling",
        "Halfway through the fall",
        "When the cord starts stretching",
        "At the lowest point of fall"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Gravitational PE = mgh, depends on height. Maximum height = maximum PE, which is at the starting point before falling."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "A car accelerates from rest. What happens to its kinetic energy?",
      "options": [
        "Decreases then increases",
        "Remains constant",
        "Increases proportionally with time",
        "Increases with square of speed"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "KE = ½mv². If speed doubles, KE increases by 4 times (2²=4). KE increases with the square of speed, not proportionally with speed or time."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "A stretched rubber band stores energy. What type of energy is this?",
      "options": [
        "Kinetic energy",
        "Gravitational potential energy",
        "Elastic potential energy",
        "Chemical potential energy"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Stretched or compressed elastic objects store elastic potential energy, which can be released when they return to original shape."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "A pendulum swings back and forth. At the highest point of its swing, what type of energy is maximum?",
      "options": [
        "Kinetic energy",
        "Elastic potential energy",
        "Gravitational potential energy",
        "Thermal energy"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "At the highest point, the pendulum has maximum height above its lowest point, so it has maximum gravitational potential energy. It has zero kinetic energy at this instant."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "Which factor does NOT affect the gravitational potential energy of an object?",
      "options": [
        "Mass of object",
        "Height above reference point",
        "Gravitational field strength",
        "Speed of object"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "GPE = mgh, depends on mass (m), height (h), and gravitational field strength (g). Speed affects kinetic energy, not GPE."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "A force is applied to compress a spring. What happens if the force exceeds the spring's elastic limit?",
      "options": [
        "Spring becomes stiffer",
        "Spring obeys Hooke's Law better",
        "Spring becomes more elastic",
        "Spring deforms permanently"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Beyond elastic limit, material undergoes plastic deformation - it won't return to original shape when force is removed. Permanent deformation occurs."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "Two boxes are lifted to the same shelf. Box A is heavier than Box B. Which has more gravitational potential energy?",
      "options": [
        "Box A only",
        "Box B only",
        "Both have the same",
        "Cannot determine without heights"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "GPE = mgh. Same height (h), same g. Larger mass (m) means larger GPE. Box A (heavier) has more GPE."
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "A ball is thrown vertically upward. Ignoring air resistance, what is true about its total mechanical energy during flight?",
      "options": [
        "Increases then decreases",
        "Decreases steadily",
        "Remains constant",
        "Increases steadily"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "With no air resistance, total mechanical energy (KE + GPE) is conserved - remains constant. KE converts to GPE on way up, GPE converts to KE on way down."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "Which type of force can act at a distance without physical contact?",
      "options": [
        "Frictional force",
        "Normal force",
        "Tension force",
        "Magnetic force"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Magnetic force can act through empty space without contact. Friction, normal force, and tension all require physical contact between objects."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "A toy car rolls down a ramp, across a flat surface, and up another ramp. It reaches a lower height on the second ramp. What accounts for the 'lost' energy?",
      "options": [
        "Energy was destroyed",
        "Energy converted to heat/sound through friction",
        "Gravity became weaker",
        "Energy was stored in the car"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Energy is conserved but converts to other forms. Friction converts mechanical energy (KE/PE) to thermal energy (heat) and sound, so less mechanical energy remains."
