    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "Which symbol means 'is an element of'?",
      "options": ["⊆", "∉", "∈", "∩"],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "∈ means 'is an element of'. Example: 3 ∈ {1,2,3,4} means 3 is an element of the set."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "If A = {2, 4, 6} and B = {4, 5, 6}, what is A ∩ B?",
      "options": ["{2, 4, 5, 6}", "{4, 6}", "{2, 5}", "{ }"],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Intersection (∩) means elements that are in BOTH sets. Both A and B contain 4 and 6, so A ∩ B = {4, 6}."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "If P = {a, b, c} and Q = {c, d, e}, what is P ∪ Q?",
      "options": ["{a, b, c, d, e}", "{c}", "{a, b, d, e}", "{a, b, c}"],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Union (∪) means all elements from BOTH sets (without repeating). P ∪ Q = {a, b, c, d, e}."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "Given the universal set ξ = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and set A = {2, 4}, what is A'?",
      "options": ["{2, 4}", "{1, 3, 5}", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}", "{ }"],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A' (complement of A) means all elements in the universal set that are NOT in A. So A' = {1, 3, 5}."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Which statement is TRUE for sets X = {1, 2, 3} and Y = {1, 2, 3, 4}?",
      "options": ["X ∈ Y", "X ⊂ Y", "Y ⊂ X", "X = Y"],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "⊂ means 'is a proper subset of'. All elements of X are in Y, and Y has extra elements, so X ⊂ Y is true."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "If M = {p, q, r} and N = {s, t}, what is M ∩ N?",
      "options": ["{p, q, r, s, t}", "{p, q, r}", "{ }", "{s, t}"],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "M and N have no elements in common, so their intersection is the empty set { } (also written as ∅)."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "Which set is described by {x : x is an odd number less than 10}?",
      "options": ["{1, 3, 5, 7, 9}", "{2, 4, 6, 8}", "{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}", "{0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9}"],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Odd numbers less than 10 are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. The set-builder notation {x : condition} means 'the set of all x such that the condition is true'."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "If ξ = {a, b, c, d, e}, R = {a, c, e}, what is n(R)?",
      "options": ["2", "3", "5", "0"],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "n(R) means the number of elements in set R. R has 3 elements (a, c, e), so n(R) = 3."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "Which Venn diagram region represents elements that are in set A but NOT in set B?",
      "options": ["The overlapping part of A and B", "The part of A outside B", "The part of B outside A", "Outside both A and B"],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Elements in A but NOT in B = A ∩ B' = the part of circle A that does not overlap with B."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "If A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {1, 2, 3}, which statement is TRUE?",
      "options": ["A ⊂ B", "A ≠ B", "A = B", "A ∩ B = { }"],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Two sets are equal if they contain exactly the same elements. Since A and B both contain 1, 2, 3, we have A = B."
