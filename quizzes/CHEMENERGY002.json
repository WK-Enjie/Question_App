    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "A catalyst affects a reaction by:",
      "options": [
        "Making ΔH more negative",
        "Increasing the energy of products",
        "Lowering the activation energy",
        "Changing the overall enthalpy change"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Catalysts provide an alternative reaction pathway with lower activation energy. They do NOT change ΔH or the relative energies of reactants/products."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "In an energy profile diagram, adding a catalyst will:",
      "options": [
        "Raise the peak of the curve",
        "Lower the peak but keep reactant/product levels unchanged",
        "Lower the energy of the products",
        "Make ΔH more exothermic"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Catalysts lower the activation energy barrier (peak height) but do not alter the starting (reactants) or ending (products) energy levels, so ΔH remains unchanged."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "2.0 g of ethanol (C₂H₅OH) is completely combusted. If the enthalpy of combustion is −1370 kJ/mol, how much energy is released? (M_r of ethanol = 46)",
      "options": [
        "−29.8 kJ",
        "−59.6 kJ",
        "−1370 kJ",
        "−2740 kJ"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Moles of ethanol = 2.0 g ÷ 46 g/mol = 0.0435 mol. Energy released = 0.0435 mol × 1370 kJ/mol = 59.6 kJ. Negative sign indicates exothermic release."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "During an exothermic reaction in an open beaker, the temperature of the surroundings will:",
      "options": [
        "Increase",
        "Decrease",
        "Remain constant",
        "First decrease then increase"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Exothermic reactions release heat to the surroundings. In an open system, this causes the temperature of the surroundings (e.g., air, container) to increase."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Which statement about catalysts is FALSE?",
      "options": [
        "They increase reaction rate",
        "They are not consumed in the reaction",
        "They make endothermic reactions exothermic",
        "They lower activation energy"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Catalysts do NOT change the thermodynamics (ΔH) of a reaction. An endothermic reaction remains endothermic; a catalyst only speeds up how fast equilibrium is reached."

    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "The combustion of methane has ΔH = −890 kJ/mol. How much energy is released when 8.0 g of methane burns completely? (M_r CH₄ = 16)",

        "−890 kJ",
        "−1780 kJ"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Moles of methane = 8.0 g ÷ 16 g/mol = 0.50 mol. Energy released = 0.50 mol × 890 kJ/mol = 445 kJ (exothermic, so negative sign implied)."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "An endothermic reaction feels cold to the touch because:",
      "options": [
        "It releases cold energy",
        "It absorbs thermal energy from your hand",
        "Its products have zero energy",
        "The activation energy is very high"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Endothermic reactions absorb heat from their surroundings. When you touch the container, heat flows from your hand into the reaction mixture, making it feel cold."

    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "What happens to ΔH when a catalyst is added to an exothermic reaction?",
      "options": [
        "Becomes more negative",
        "Becomes less negative",
        "Remains unchanged",
        "Becomes positive"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "ΔH is a state function depending only on initial and final states. Catalysts affect kinetics (reaction pathway) but not thermodynamics (ΔH value)."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "1.6 g of methane (CH₄, M_r = 16) is burned completely. If ΔH_comb = −890 kJ/mol, what is the energy change?",

        "−445 kJ",
        "−890 kJ"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Moles of methane = 1.6 g ÷ 16 g/mol = 0.10 mol. Energy released = 0.10 mol × 890 kJ/mol = 89 kJ (exothermic, so ΔH = −89 kJ)."

      "id": 10,
      "question": "Which statement correctly describes the effect of a catalyst on an energy profile diagram?",
      "options": [
        "It lowers both reactant and product energy levels equally",
        "It creates a new pathway with a lower 'hill' between reactants and products",
        "It shifts the entire curve downward",
        "It eliminates the activation energy barrier completely"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Catalysts provide an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy barrier (smaller 'hill'), but reactant/product energy levels—and therefore ΔH—remain identical."

    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "The enthalpy of neutralisation for strong acid + strong alkali is −57 kJ/mol of water formed. What energy change occurs when 0.040 mol of HCl reacts completely with NaOH?",

        "−5.70 kJ",
        "−11.4 kJ"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "0.040 mol HCl produces 0.040 mol water. Energy change = 0.040 mol × 57 kJ/mol = 2.28 kJ released (exothermic, so negative)."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,

        "+90 kJ",
        "+180 kJ"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Moles = 6.8 g ÷ 34 g/mol = 0.20 mol. Energy absorbed = 0.20 mol × 90 kJ/mol = 18 kJ. Positive ΔH means endothermic (energy absorbed)."

      "id": 13,
      "question": "Which process would feel warm/hot to the touch?",
      "options": [

        "Photosynthesis in leaves",
        "Burning magnesium ribbon",
        "Evaporation of ethanol"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Burning magnesium is highly exothermic (ΔH very negative), releasing large amounts of heat to surroundings → feels hot. The other options are endothermic processes that feel cold."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "2.4 g of carbon (M_r = 12) is burned completely. If ΔH_comb = −394 kJ/mol, what is the energy change?",

        "−394 kJ",
        "−788 kJ"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Moles C = 2.4 g ÷ 12 g/mol = 0.20 mol. Energy released = 0.20 mol × 394 kJ/mol = 78.8 kJ (exothermic, so ΔH = −78.8 kJ)."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "Why might a highly exothermic reaction (large negative ΔH) still require heating to start?",
      "options": [
        "ΔH becomes positive when heated",
        "The reaction has a high activation energy barrier",
        "Catalysts are always needed for exothermic reactions",
        "Heat is needed to make ΔH more negative"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Even highly exothermic reactions may have a large activation energy barrier that must be overcome for bonds to break and rearrange. Initial heating provides this energy; once started, the reaction sustains itself by releasing heat."
